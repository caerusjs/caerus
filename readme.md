# Caerus Framework

## What is it?
An opinionated framework and ecosystem for building web applications with the goal of rapid development and low maintenence.

## Command Line Interface

The Caerus Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to initialise new projects and to generate scaffolding for existing projects. Itâ€™s an essential part of using Caerus.

### Installing the Caerus CLI Tool

Install the Caerus package from your workspace folder to get started:

`$ yarn global add caerus`

## CLI Commands

The Caerus CLI supports the following abilities:

- Initialising projects (TBA)
- Generating end-to-end resources including tests (TBA)
- Generating entities
- Generating resolvers (TBA)
- Generating views (TBA)
- Generating migrations (TBA)
- Generating types (TBA)

### Generating Entities

To generate an entity with default columns (id, createdAt, updatedAt and deletedAt) and graphql typedefs, run the following command from the root of your project:

`$ yarn caerus generate entity [name]`

Where `name` is the name of your resource.  Entities should be singular and use `-` for multiple words, e.g. `blog-post`.
